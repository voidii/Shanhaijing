Whoever saw this words, that means you have spent quite some time on this game that I made and I just want to say thank you. So far this is all I have made. I intended to make this scene the beginning of my game as a tutorialpart, to show players what this game's combat system is like and what the story is roughly about. The reason I used a big panda as ChiYou was that I could not find anything art resource that really fits the look of ChiYou and it was said that ChiYou used to ride a panda on the battlefiled. I did not mean to use the assets from MapleStory, I just personally really like that game and it is the best free asset I can find for my game. 
I tried to make the sword like the skill from League of Legend's Gnar's Q, but I failed to make the sword shows its returning trail, and I don't know why sometimes it will just fly upwards. Anyway, I am sorry for all bugs in this version, even though this is supposed to be the Gold Master. The dodge system was supposed to be the core in this game but it is not working as I hoped it would. There are still a lot of improvment that I need to figure out how to do. 
Thank you again, for playing my game, even though it is not very fun and very bugged. Now, if you will excuse me, I am gonna go playing Cyberpunk 2077, which is also very bugged lol.
