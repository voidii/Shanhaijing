With the help of gods, XuanYuan defeated the Master of War of JiuLi, ChiYou. But XuanYuan knew that this was not the end of everything.
The contract XuanYuan signed with gods will one day casue huge disaster to HuaXia nation and by that time he would not be around. XuanYuan was not sure if his offsprings and people would have power to fight against gods, or if JiuLi would come back to this world. NvWa did not want to see her creation to be bounded by the contract of gods so she and FuXi used all of their power to sealed gods in the chaos to keep gods away from human being. After this, NvWa and FuXi disappeared on the world. XuanYuan was afriad of gods coming back and the offspring of ChiYou might resurrect ChiYou one day so he left XuanYuan Sword to his child, in case that in the future HuaXia people might need its power again. 
What XuanYuan did not know was that the moment he sigend the contract with gods, the conscious of gods had been sealed inside HuaXia people's blood. That part of Gods conscious has been waiting for the right time to wake up for thousands of years.

No one survived that crash except Zhou Lian. Zhou Lian claimed to see a huge monster flying outside the plane but no one took him seriously. Even Zhou Lian began to believe it was nothing but a nightmare he had when he was little, until he saw that monster again on his 18 birthday....
