Known bugs: The stones work fine now, yeah, only took me two days. FOr now, the dialog could mess up if player presses F too quick. The dodge system is werid, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. It doesn't have a exit option or winning scene yet.

I just want to say that I am doing the best I can here and I just need a little more time to polish this game. Please forgive me. I will resubmitted a version before 8 a.m. tomorrow morning. I just need a little more time.
